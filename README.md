# Facial Expression Recognition with Keras
 This repository is based on a guided project to Recognize Facial Expression with Keras hosted by Coursera Project Network.
 
In this project, we will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. We will accomplish this by completing each task in the project:

## Task List

1. **Introduction and Overview:** Get an overview of the project and its objectives.

2. **Explore the Dataset:** Analyze the dataset containing 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces and their corresponding labels.

3. **Generate Training and Validation Batches:** Preprocess the data and generate batches for training and validation.

4. **Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:** Design the architecture of the CNN model for facial expression recognition.

5. **Train and Evaluate Model:** Train the CNN model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

6. **Represent Model as JSON String:** Save the trained model architecture as a JSON string for future use.

7. **Create a Flask App to Serve Predictions:** Develop a Flask application to serve predictions made by the trained model.

8. **Design an HTML Template for the Flask App:** Design an HTML template to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Flask app.

9. **Use Model to Recognize Facial Expressions in Videos:** Implement functionality to use the trained model for real-time facial expression recognition in videos.
